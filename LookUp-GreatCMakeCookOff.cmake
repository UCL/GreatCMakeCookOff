# This file is part of the GreatCMakeCookOff package and distributed under the MIT Licences.

# CMake. It should be added explicitely to build systems that make use of recipes from the cook-off.
# And it should be included prior to using cook-off recipes:
#
# ```{CMake}
# include(LookUp-GreatCMakeCookOff)
